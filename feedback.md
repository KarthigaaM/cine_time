##Date 15th April

#Folders and filename appropriate - nicely done
#Assignment not complete it should have two pages
#Assignment is missing the complete requirements such as grid layout of 8 and 4 and reverse
#Comments in HTMl - quite good however could not find the same in the CSS File
#Code indented in HTML - but was not done in the case of CSS
#Except for Header and Nav - the rest of the page is not coming properly
#960 Grid not used as the path is incorrect in the link tag
#The whole page looks messy
#Images are not loading - incorrectly referenced -bg.jpg and bg2.jpg
